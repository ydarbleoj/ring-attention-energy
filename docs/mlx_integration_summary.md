# MLX Energy Pipeline Implementation Summary

## 🎉 COMPLETED: Full MLX Integration for Ring Attention Training

### Overview

We've successfully implemented a complete MLX-ready energy ML pipeline that transforms raw EIA energy data into training-ready sequences for ring attention models. The integration builds on our established foundation of schema validation, Polars/Parquet storage, and test-driven development.

## 🔧 Components Delivered

### 1. Feature Engineering Module (`src/core/ml/features.py`)

**EnergyFeatureEngineer Class** - Comprehensive feature engineering for energy time series:

```python
feature_engineer = EnergyFeatureEngineer()
df_with_features = feature_engineer.create_all_features(df)
# Result: 25x+ feature expansion (6 → 153 columns)
```

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Temporal Features**: Cyclical encodings (hour/day/month), binary flags (weekend, peak hours)
- **Energy-Specific**: Renewable penetration, intermittency metrics, capacity factors
- **Supply-Demand**: Grid stress indicators, reserve margins, balance metrics
- **Time Series**: Configurable lags and rolling statistics
- **MLX Conversion**: Normalized arrays ready for training

### 2. Sequence Generation (`src/core/ml/sequence_generator.py`)

**SequenceGenerator Class** - Training sequence creation:

```python
seq_gen = SequenceGenerator(sequence_length=168, stride=24)
sequences = seq_gen.create_sequences(df)
# Result: Iterator of (input, target) MLX arrays
```

**RingAttentionSequenceGenerator Class** - Distributed training support:

```python
ring_gen = RingAttentionSequenceGenerator(sequence_length=8760, ring_size=4)
partitions = ring_gen.create_ring_sequences(df)
# Result: 4 partitions for distributed ring attention
```

### 3. Data Integration (`src/core/ml/data_loaders.py`)

**EnergyDataLoader Class** - High-level pipeline integration:

```python
loader = EnergyDataLoader.create_from_storage(storage_path, api_key)
df = loader.load_training_data(start_date, end_date, region="PACW")
```

**High-Level Pipeline Function**:

```python
input_seqs, target_seqs, features = create_energy_sequence_dataset(
    df, sequence_length=168, feature_engineer=engineer
)
# Result: Complete training dataset with engineered features
```
